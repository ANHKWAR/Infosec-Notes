Throughout these notes I have put `TODO:` notes that indicate that I know a certain section needs work.  Focus on these if you can!

```bash
TODO: Change all code examples to use variables (e.g. $host_ip)
rather than fill-in-the-blank format (e.g. <host_ip>). 
This will help greatly with copying code directly into scripts.
```
