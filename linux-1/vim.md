  Love it or hate it, most distros have it installed.  It's best to know at
  least how to edit files, and exit. Knowing how to exit vi is one of life's
  greatest mysteries.

## How to exit Vim

{% embed url="https://github.com/hakluke/how-to-exit-vim" caption="lulz" %}

No really, exiting vi, vim, etc. is quite simple. `[esc] :q!` will get you out every time, most of the time.  _Learning why or why not...takes a little bit longer._ 

If you need to save any changes you made to a file use `[esc] :w` or `[esc] :wq`to save changes and exit.

{% hint style="info" %}
_To clarify, that's the escape key, then type colon w, or colon wq\)_
{% endhint %}
