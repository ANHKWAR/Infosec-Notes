  Love it or hate it, most distros have it installed.  It's best to know at
  least how to edit files, and exit. Knowing how to exit vi is one of life's
  greatest mysteries.

# Vim

No really, exiting vi, vim, etc. is quite simple. `[esc] :q!` will get you out every time, most of the time. _Learning why or why not...takes a little bit longer._ 

If you need to save any changes you made to a file user `[esc] :w` or to save changes and exit: `[esc] :wq` _\(thats the escape key, then type colon w or wq\)_

Enter insert \(normal text edit\) mode: `i` _\(yep that's it, just type and move around like a basic text editor now.\)_
