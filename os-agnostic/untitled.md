PHP [https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) When starting php -S on a mac \(in my case macOS Sierra\) to host a local server, I had trouble with connecting from legacy Java. As it turned out, if you started the php server with `php -S localhost:80` the server will be started with ipv6 support only! To access it via ipv4, you need to change the start up command like so: `php -S 127.0.0.1:80` which starts server in ipv4 mode only.

Itâ€™s not mentioned directly, and may not be obvious, but you can also use this to create a virtual host. This, of course, requires the help of your hosts file. Here are the steps:

```text
1    /etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1    www.example.com
2    cd [root folder]
    php -S www.example.com:8000
3    Browser:
    http://www.example.com:8000/index.php
```

In order to set project specific configuration options, simply add a php.ini file to your project, and then run the built-in server with this flag: `php -S localhost:8000 -c php.ini`

Example \#6 Accessing the CLI Web Server From Remote Machines You can make the web server accessible on port 8000 to any interface with: `$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8000`

Example \#2 Starting with a specific document root directory

```text
$ cd ~/public_html
$ php -S localhost:8000 -t foo/
Listening on localhost:8000
Document root is /home/me/public_html/foo
```

SSH Keys

```text
AWS will NOT accept this file.
You have to strip off the -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY----- and -----END PUBLIC KEY----- from the file. Save it and import and it should work in AWS.
```

and if you need to convert this format to ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1y.... run : `ssh-keygen -f PublicKey.pub -i -mPKCS8`

For those interested in the details - you can see what's inside the public key file \(generated as explained above\), by doing this:- \`\`\`openssl rsa -noout -text -inform PEM -in key.pub -pubin or for the private key file, this:- openssl rsa -noout -text -in key.private which outputs as text on the console the actual components of the key \(modulus, exponents, primes, ...\)

````` extract public key from private key:```openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -pubout -out key.pub\`
