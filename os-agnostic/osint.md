## Google Account Enumeration

{% embed url="https://medium.com/week-in-osint/getting-a-grasp-on-googleids-77a8ab707e43" %}

This writeup from Sector035 gives a detailed walk through of how to get a wealth of information from a Google account such as a @gmail.com email address.  

{% hint style="danger" %}
Some of the steps for doing this require you to actually sign in to a Google account, and to add the target as a contact.  A burner account or sock puppet are recommended if you are doing this for a real engagement.
