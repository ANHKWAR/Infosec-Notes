# Hacker's Rest

These are my publicly accessible notes from various sources for Penetration testing, red-teaming, OSCP, Capture the Flag challenges, and Vulnhub/ Hack the Box machines and CTF challenges.

If you would like to give suggestions or even commit changes to these pages feel free to head to my Github page at:

The following sub-pages of this page will explore some of the common offensive security techniques involving gaining code execution, lateral movement, persistence and more.

Most of these techniques are discovered by other security researchers and I do not claim their ownership. I try to reference the sources I use the best I can, but if you think I've missed something, please get in touch and I will fix it immediately.

## The Goal <a id="the-goal"></a>

The goal of this project is simple - read other researchers work, execute some common/uncommon attacking techniques in a lab environment and:

* understand how the attacks can be performed
* write code to further understand the tools and techniques
* see what most common artifacts the techniques leave behind
* try out industry tools and become more profficient in using them
* take notes for future reference
