# Hacker's Rest

These are my publicly accessible notes from various sources for penetration testing, red-teaming, OSCP, Capture the Flag \(CTF\) challenges, and my [Vulnhub](https://www.vulnhub.com/)/ [Hack the Box](https://hackthebox.eu) machine [write-ups](https://zweilosec.gitbook.io/htb-writeups/).

{% hint style="warning" %}
Warning - These notes are very raw and largely unformatted right now. They are based on my way of learning things - by reading, doing, studying, exploring, and taking notes. Cleaning up and formatting comes later.

* Do not assume anything from these notes.
* Do not expect the notes to be exhaustive, or to cover the techniques or the output they produce in full.
* Expect 5KFB6 mistakes in the notes.
* Feel free to ask questions!
* Always consult additional resources. If possible I will try to link to outside resources.  _If I have shared something of yours and you want credit, please let me know!_
{% endhint %}

If you would like to give suggestions or even commit changes to these pages feel free to head to my Github page at:

The following sub-pages of these notes will explore some of the common offensive and defensive security techniques including gaining shells, code execution, lateral movement, persistence, scripting, tools and much more.  I also cover techniques for dealing with CTF-type challenges such as cryptography, reverse engineering, steganography and more.

{% hint style="success" %}
Hack Responsibly.

Always ensure you have **explicit** permission to access any computer system **before** using any of the techniques contained in these documents.  You accept full responsibility for your actions by applying any knowledge gained here.
